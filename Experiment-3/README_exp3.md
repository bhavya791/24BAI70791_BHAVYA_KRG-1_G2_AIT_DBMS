# Experiment – 3

## 1. Aim of the Session
To understand the basic structure of a PL/SQL program by creating and executing a simple PL/SQL block that includes Declaration and Execution sections and to display output using built-in procedures.

## 2. Software Requirements
Database Management System: PostgreSQL  
Database Administration Tool: pgAdmin  

## 3. Objectives
To learn the structure of a PL/SQL block.  

To use the DECLARE section for variable declaration.  

To use the BEGIN…END block for execution.  

To display output using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE.  

## 4. Procedure of the Experiment
Open pgAdmin and connect to the PostgreSQL database.  

Open the Query Tool.  

Write a PL/SQL program with:  

Declaration section  

Execution section  

Declare variables for employee details.  

Display the variable values using output statements.  

Execute the program and observe the result.  

## 5. Practical / Experiment Steps
Enable server output.  

Declare variables emp_id, emp_name, and emp_salary.  

Assign values to these variables.  

Print the values using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE.  

End the PL/SQL block.  

## 6. Input / Output Details and Screenshot
Program (Input):

Output:

## 7. Learning Outcome
Understood the basic structure of a PL/SQL block.  

Learned how to declare and initialize variables.  

Learned how to execute statements inside BEGIN…END block.  

Learned how to display output using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE.
