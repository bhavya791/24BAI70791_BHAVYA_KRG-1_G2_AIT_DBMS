# Lab Experiment 1 
Library Management System using PostgreSQL

## Experiment
To design and implement a Library Management System database using PostgreSQL that manages information about books, members, and issue records with role-based access control.

## Objective
- To create tables for books, members, and issue records.  
- To perform INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.  
- To apply Primary Key, Foreign Key, and CHECK constraints.  
- To implement role-based access control using GRANT and REVOKE commands.

## Procedure of the Experiment
1. PostgreSQL server is started and user logs in.  
2. Tables for Books, Members, and Issue Records are created.  
3. Records are inserted into the tables.  
4. SQL queries such as SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE are executed.  
5. A librarian role is created and permissions are granted.  
6. DELETE permission on Books table is revoked.  
7. Outputs are verified and screenshots are taken.

## Practical / Experiment Steps
SQL commands are written to:
- Create tables  
- Insert records  
- Update available book copies  
- Delete issue records  
- Create librarian role  
- Grant and revoke permissions  

## Input / Output Details and Screenshots
**Input:**  
Book details, member details, and issue records are provided as input.

**Output:**  
Tables are created successfully and records are inserted.  
Queries return correct results and role-based access is implemented.

Screenshots of execution and output are attached in the repository.

## Learning Outcome
- Learned to create relational database tables using constraints.  
- Understood CRUD operations in PostgreSQL.  
- Learned role-based access control using GRANT and REVOKE.  
- Gained practical exposure to Library Management System database design.
