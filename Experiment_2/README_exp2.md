# Lab Experiment 2  
SQL SELECT Queries using WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY

## Experiment
To retrieve and analyze employee data using SQL SELECT queries with WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY clauses.

## Objective
- To practice writing SQL SELECT queries.  
- To filter records using the WHERE clause.  
- To group records using the GROUP BY clause.  
- To apply conditions on grouped data using the HAVING clause.  
- To sort query results using the ORDER BY clause.  
- To use aggregate functions such as AVG() for data analysis.

## Procedure of the Experiment
An EMPLOYEE table is created with fields emp_id, emp_name, department, salary and joining_date. Sample records are inserted into the table. SQL queries are executed using WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY clauses to display department-wise average salary based on given conditions.

## Practical / Experiment Steps
SQL commands are written to:
- Create the EMPLOYEE table  
- Insert employee records  
- Retrieve department-wise average salary  
- Filter records using WHERE clause  
- Filter grouped data using HAVING clause  
- Sort results using ORDER BY clause  

## Input / Output Details and Screenshots
**Input:**  
Employee details such as emp_id, emp_name, department, salary and joining_date are provided as input.

**Output:**  
The output displays department-wise average salary for employees whose salary is greater than 20000 and whose department average salary is greater than 30000. The final result is arranged in descending order of average salary.

Screenshots of table creation, data insertion and query execution are included in the repository.

## Learning Outcome
- Understood the use of WHERE clause for filtering records.  
- Learned grouping of records using GROUP BY clause.  
- Learned to apply conditions on grouped data using HAVING clause.  
- Learned sorting of results using ORDER BY clause.  
- Gained practical knowledge of aggregate functions in SQL.
